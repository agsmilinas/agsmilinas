        <h2>Alejandro Salinas-Medina, Ph.D. Candidate</h2>
        <p>Short Bio</p>
        <p>Alejandro Salinas-Medina is a highly experienced Ph.D. candidate at McGill University, specializing in Computational Science with a focus on neuroimaging and brain simulations. With nearly a decade of industry experience working at renowned organizations like Google, Coca-Cola, and IBM, Alejandro brings a unique blend of applied expertise in AI, machine learning, big data, and cloud solutions. His research is at the forefront of neuroimaging, integrating advanced neuroimaging data with computational models to simulate deep brain activity.

            One of his notable projects, the **BBNM: Scalable Framework for Region-Specific Brain Network Models**, integrates multimodal data for deep brain activity simulation. This groundbreaking framework is currently under peer revision by MNI research associate PJ Toussaint and postdoctoral fellow Gonzalez. Another key contribution is Alejandro‚Äôs work on **neuron-level analysis of the BigBrain**, where he developed a highly efficient neuron segmentation and feature extraction script. This script automates the processing of NIfTI brain imaging files using anisotropic diffusion and CuPy for GPU acceleration, detecting cell centroids and segmenting cells to extract morphological features such as area, perimeter, and intensity. This work has been accepted for flash talks and poster presentations at MAIN 2024.
            
            In addition, Alejandro has been working on **Nsc data mining using large language models (LLMs)**. His efforts have enhanced the first pipeline using GPT-3.5 Turbo by introducing annotation through title and paper title matching. His optimized prompt design for detecting the HCP dataset has achieved an accuracy of 0.85 and an F1-score of 0.61, showcasing his ability to drive innovations in computational neuroscience and data mining.
            
            Alejandro‚Äôs wealth of professional experience, combined with his cutting-edge research, positions him as a leader in bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications in computational neuroscience.</p>
