            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Short Bio</p>
            <p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at McGill University, affiliated with MILA (Quebec AI Institute) and The Neuro, where my research focuses on developing scalable, biologically informed modeling frameworks using high-resolution multimodal data. My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering from ITESM and continued with a Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering from UNAM, where I built a real-time sign language translator using deep convolutional networks. I’m also a teaching assistant at McGill and have previously served as a guest professor in Big Data & Analytics at Universidad Iberoamericana.</p>

            <p>Alongside my academic work, I bring nearly a decade of industry experience. I’ve worked across roles such as Lead Data Scientist at Distillery, AI/ML Cloud Solutions Engineer at Google, and Senior Data Scientist at Coca-Cola, with additional experience at IBM, Lumiata, and P&G. These roles allowed me to deploy scalable AI systems, lead cross-functional teams, and contribute to projects at the intersection of machine learning, big data, and cloud infrastructure.</p>
            
            <p>My expertise spans deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and responsible AI, supported by multiple certifications including Google Cloud’s Professional ML Engineer and the DeepLearning.AI specializations. I’m passionate about bridging rigorous academic research with real-world applications—whether through advanced simulation models, AI for medical imaging, or multimodal integration techniques—and translating those into technologies that can impact science and society.</p>

    <li><strong>New Role: PhD Research Lead for VODABI-Mila Collaboration (May–September 2025)</strong>
        <p>I'm excited to take on the role of PhD research lead for a collaborative project between <strong>VODABI</strong> and <strong>Mila</strong> focused on multilingual dialogue state tracking and LLM-based conversation analysis in the financial sector.</p>
        <p>This applied research sprint aims to reduce QA review time by 80% and improve contract-win prediction accuracy by 15%. We're now advancing toward real-time summarization tools for agents and deploying a proof-of-concept system with a Tier-1 Canadian bank.</p>
        <p>This role has been a rewarding opportunity to translate cutting-edge academic research into high-impact, production-ready AI systems.</p>

                        <p>This study presents a comprehensive framework for conducting neuron-level analysis of the BigBrain dataset, focusing on 1-micron sections. The methodology involves selecting and tiling specific dataset sections, followed by segmentation and morphological feature extraction from each tile. These data are standardized by transforming them into a registered space, allowing for consistent analysis across sections. Point cloud features such as nearest neighbor, 3D convex hull, and second-order features are used to analyze the spatial organization and structural properties of neurons. The results provide deeper insights into neuronal architecture at the microscale, contributing to both neuroscience and computational modeling fields.</p>
